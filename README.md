# Dungeon-Adventure
A short text based game I'm making to help improve my c++ coding


If anyone besides me looks at this file, please keep in mind that I'm only just learning c++. I'm self taught and often times I don't learn the best way to program until I've written the code improperly first. I usually start projects that require knowledge just beyond what I currently know, in order to help me grow as I solidify the knowledge I already have.
