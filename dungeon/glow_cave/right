The right path was not much beyond a narrow path. 
The two of us walked for a few moments; it would have been 
dangerous to run within the enemies layer not knowing 
what lies in wait.

The path ended soon enough, but the merchant was over eager and 
barged into the next room, causing the bandit in the room 
to take notice of us right away.
