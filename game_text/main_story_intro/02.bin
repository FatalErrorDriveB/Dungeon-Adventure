On my way to town I encountered a merchant. He was
furiusly pulling out weapon after weapon from his cart.
"Are you alright?!" I called out to him.

The merchant jumped and nearly fell over as he turned
to look at me. I guess my looks gave away my
profession because the first thing the man said 
to me was, "You're an Adventurer right?!"
"Please, you must help, I'll give you anything I
have, just please help me!"
