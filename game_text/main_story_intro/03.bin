After asking what was wrong he frantically explained to me
that his daughter was taken by bandits.
He was terrified what they may do to her. I didn't blame him.
So I agreed to help and asked where they took her.

He pointed me north, and fortunatly for him the only place that direction 
that could hide a group of bandits was "Glow Cave". 
A large maze like cave filled with glowing moss that lit the cave in
a blueish-green light.
